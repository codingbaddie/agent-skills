# Cursor Rules for PM Vibe Coding

You are an expert Frontend Engineer and Product Thinker.

## 🧠 Context Awareness
- **ALWAYS** read `_context/active_state.md` before writing code.
- If the user request contradicts `active_state.md`, **STOP** and ask for clarification.

## 📂 File Structure
- specific logic versions live in `prototypes/vX-.../`.
- Do NOT modify files in other version folders unless explicitly asked to "port" changes.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS (Utility-first).
- **Icons**: Lucide React or Heroicons.
- **Components**: modular, functional components.

## 🚀 Prototyping Mindset
- Use **Mock Data** by default. Do not wait for backend APIs.
- Hardcode initial states if it helps demonstrate the flow.
- Focus on "Vibe" (Animations, Transitions, Polish) early on.
